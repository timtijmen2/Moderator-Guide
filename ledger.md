Ledger is a mod that logs many actions and interaction in the world, these actions can be rolled back by the mod as well.

Note: Ledger is a very powerfull tool which will do **exactly** what you tell it to do! If you say "rollback this area" without giving it a time, it will rollback that area to *from the begining of time*. If you dont put in a range or area, it will do the rollback *for the entire world.* So be very specific with what you ask it to do.
